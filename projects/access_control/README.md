- **Description**: Unix/Linux system security and file permission management
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Unix file system security
  - Permission management and auditing
  - System hardening techniques
  - Security best practices implementation

## Key Competencies
- **Identity Management**: User lifecycle management and provisioning
- **Access Control Models**: RBAC, ABAC, and DAC implementation
- **Authentication Systems**: Multi-factor authentication and SSO
- **Authorization Frameworks**: Policy-based access control
- **Audit and Compliance**: Access logging and monitoring

## Access Control Models
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigning permissions based on job functions
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Dynamic access control based on attributes
- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: Owner-based permission management
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: System-enforced security policies

## Implementation Areas
- **User Provisioning**: Automated user account management
- **Privileged Access Management**: Elevated privilege control
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and monitoring
- **Access Reviews**: Regular access validation and cleanup
- **Compliance Reporting**: Audit trail and compliance documentation

## Tools and Technologies
- **Identity Providers**: Active Directory, LDAP, SAML
- **Access Management**: IAM platforms and SSO solutions
- **Monitoring Tools**: SIEM and access logging systems
- **Compliance Tools**: Audit and reporting platforms
- **Security Frameworks**: Zero Trust and least privilege principles

## Industry Standards
- NIST Digital Identity Guidelines
- ISO 27001 Access Control Requirements
- CIS Controls for Access Management
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
