   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vps_update_automation.git
   cd vps_update_automation
   ```

2. Copy the example configuration:
   ```bash
   cp config/config.example.json config/config.json
   ```

3. Edit the configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano config/config.json
   ```

4. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   chmod +x tests/*.sh
   ```

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   Add the following line (adjust the path as needed):
   ```
   0 2 * * * /path/to/vps_update_automation/scripts/auto_update.sh
   ```

        "check_interval": 300
    }
}
```

### System Monitoring

    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive information (passwords, tokens) should be stored securely
- The script should be run with appropriate permissions
- Regular security audits should be performed
- Keep the system and all dependencies up to date
- Monitor the logs for any suspicious activity

## Testing

The test suite includes comprehensive tests for all modules:

- Security module tests
- Monitoring module tests
- Logging module tests
- Validation module tests
- Backup module tests

To run the tests:
```bash
./tests/run_tests.sh
```
